Hereâ€™s a concise and professional README file for your Mental Health Prediction Model:

Mental Health Prediction Model
A machine learning project designed to predict mental health conditions using survey data, leveraging robust preprocessing and classification techniques.

Features
Implemented an AdaBoost Classifier for superior predictive performance.
Comprehensive preprocessing pipeline including:
Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical variables.
Scaling numerical features.
Compared algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM.
Fine-tuned hyperparameters using Grid Search and Random Search for improved accuracy.
Evaluated using metrics such as ROC-AUC and F1-Score.
Technology Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pandas
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/aryanshukla25/Mental-Health-Prediction.git  
cd Mental-Health-Prediction  
Install dependencies:
